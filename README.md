# Teleprinter-FSG
## Description 
---
This is a project that tries to emulate the FSG of the old phone network.
Without a FSG it is not possible to operate a teleprinter, at least not the old ones.
The goal of the project is to establish communication between a PC and the teleprinter and 
also between two separate teleprinter.

This project does not only provide the code for the uC, but also the files for the hardware side.
We know that there is already a project, called the iTelex, but this one is way to complicated and not 
really hacker friendly. (Also the hardware is way too expensive)

We want to provide an easy to use, cheap and hackable solution. 

We started this project as a university assignment and are currently working with three people on it. 
For us it is a learning experience so don't be too harsh.

Due to being a university assignment we can't allow any participants until we handed it in, so please stay put.
